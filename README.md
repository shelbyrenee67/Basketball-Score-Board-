# Basketball-Score-Board-

Welcome to my 1st solo project on Scrimba. 

In this project, I was tasked with creating a basketball scoreboard from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal (pun intended) was for there to be a score board for the home team and the guest team and that the score keeper could increment each team's points by 1, 2, and 3 points at a time. My goal was to get the functions working properly so that I can see the score in the DOM as you click the increment buttons. 

I was able to accomplish my goal on this project, which was to get the functions working. The struggle I had was with the CSS and it not being designed the way I envisioned so I will keep making changes with it until I am satisfied with the outcome.
